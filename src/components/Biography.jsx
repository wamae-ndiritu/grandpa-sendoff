          village, Kiganjo, Nyeri County. He was the last born of the Late Mzee

          Grewing up at times when there wasn't much education, Mzee Ngariuku
          attained his highest education in standard two at Kiruchu Primary
          School. Immediately, he started working as a casual labourer.

        <p className='py-4 text-lg'>
          During this time, the Mau Mau war was in it's best. Without even being
          an active fighter, he found himself and many others contributing to
          the early struggle for independence. Him and many others were
          detained, what is popularly known as{" "}
          <strong>(Gutwarwo ithamirioni)</strong>. In their detainment, they
          were forced to work under the colonial government as casual labourers.
          They participated in various constructions and development projects
          carried out by the colonial government including the construction of
          The Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. They worked as slaves
          following their failure to collaborate with the{" "}
          <strong>Mzungu</strong>. He never collaborated with them unlike the so
          called <strong>Kamatimu/Ngati</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className='py-4 text-lg'>
          Till his demise, Mzee Ngariuku has lived to enjoy the fruits of their
          struggle. He kept reminding us that those who fought for independece,
          they did so, so that future generations can live a better life in a
          better country. He also discouraged the selling of Land, and he could
          quote{" "}
          <strong>
            Kai teri uyo mutoi ni murume, njamba cia wiyathi cikuaga irumite
            teri na gudi
          </strong>{" "}
          meaning those who fought for the independence could never want other
          generations to sell their lands.
        </p>
        <p className='py-4 text-lg'>He lived with his believes and kept the oath they once took during the Mau Mau war; <strong>(Kunyua muma)</strong> and at some points he couldn't tell us more about what was happening in those old days. He was a truthful, honest man and with much wisdom such that he has impacted and will continue to impact our decisions in life as his children, grand-children and great grand-children.</p>
